Therefore, solving ocean plastic pollution requires a combination of stemming the inflow and cleaning up what has already accumulated. Wild Ocean, a non-profit organization, is developing advanced technologies to rid the world’s oceans of plastic."

Research shows the majority of plastic in the gyres by mass is currently in the larger debris. By removing the plastic while most of it is still large, we prevent it from breaking down into dangerous microplastics. Combining the cleanup with source reduction on land paves the road towards a plastic-free ocean by 2050."
